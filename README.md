## Image Scaling
A solution to do the following without the use of any image processing libraries such as OpenCV (except for loading and saving the image).
1. Load an image from the disk
2. Convert the image to gray-scale (8bpp format)
3. Re-sample the image such that the size is 0.7 times it original dimensions using linear interpolation method and save the image.
4. Re-sample the image created in (step 3) back to its original size and save the image.
5. Compute the sum of the average of the squared difference between pixels in the original image (in step 2) and the re-samples image in (step 4)

## Canny Edge Detection
A python script to implement the Canny edge detection algorithm without the use of OpenCV or similar libraries.

## Inter-means Segmentation
A program to find an image threshold based on the inter-means algorithm.
